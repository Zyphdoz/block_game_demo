The code here is not a demo for any particular game.

Many people have a tendency to use x,y and nested loops everywhere when coding falling block games. 
I think there is a nicer way to do this which involves storing the matrix in a 1d array and using offsets to represent the tetrominos.
This project is intended to serve as a code demo of that approach. 

The demo was written by me but the concepts used in the code is the brainchild of https://github.com/myndzi
Chili framework was used for detecting user input and drawing stuff to the screen. https://github.com/planetchili/chili_framework
